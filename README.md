# Personal Budget Planner

## Description

A simple Python command-line tool that helps users track their monthly budget. The program takes income and expense inputs, calculates the remaining balance, and provides financial advice based on the user's financial status. This project demonstrates my proficiency in using if statements to implement conditional logic for decision-making in Python.

## Features

  *  Accepts monthly income and expenses (rent, groceries, utilities, entertainment).
  *  Uses if statements to check for negative inputs and set them to zero, ensuring valid calculations.
  *  Calculates total expenses and remaining balance.
  *  Employs if-elif-else statements to provide tailored financial advice (e.g., surplus, balanced, or deficit) based on the   balance.
  *  Beginner-friendly, commented code for easy understanding.

## Skill Demonstration

This project showcases my ability to:
  *  Use if statements to validate user inputs (e.g., checking for negative values).
  *  Apply if-elif-else statements to create dynamic financial advice based on calculated budget outcomes.
  *  Structure clear and logical decision-making processes in Python, a fundamental programming skill.
  *  Write clean, commented code to demonstrate my understanding of conditional logic in a practical application.

## Future Enhancements:
  *  Add more expense categories using additional if statement checks.
  *  Expand the if-elif logic to include more detailed financial advice tiers.
  *  Format the output to look like a table for better readability.
